    <p class="lead">
      A fintech project manager says Apple’s strongest advantage is not a single device, but the way its hardware and software connect to deliver
      a stable, seamless experience while warning students that Apple’s high cost can make it the least practical choice for many budgets.

      <h2>Meet the interviewee</h2>
      <p>
        The interviewee, Ricky, is an Indonesian project manager at a fintech company whose work involves product development, software-related
        projects, and solving system problems across internal teams and external partners such as banks.     
      </p>
      <p>
        He said his closest stakeholders are developers/IT teams and designers, because technical feasibility, requirements, and how data is stored
        in databases directly shape what features can be built.     
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What this story is about</h2>
      <p>
        In the discussion, Ricky described Apple’s ecosystem as most beneficial for creators and developers, while students benefit the least due
        to Apple’s higher cost compared with alternatives.     
      </p>
      <p>
        He also defined “success” in choosing a laptop or platform for project work as effective task handling, stability, and a smooth overall
        experience.     
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>When the shift felt real</h2>
      <p>
        Ricky said he first felt Apple products were evolving rapidly when he noticed MacBook development accelerating with Apple’s M-series chips,
        referencing the first M1 MacBook era as the moment that stood out.     
      </p>
      <p>
        He added that he typically checks Apple updates during major chip/product launches and also during discounts, because he follows both new
        technology and pricing.     
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Where it shows up at work</h2>
      <p>
        In his workplace environment, device usage is mixed: his product team mainly uses Windows, front-end developers use Apple devices, and
        back-end developers use Windows.     
      </p>
      <p>
        He noted that this mixed setup is workable even across countries because his multinational company relies on a cross-platform collaboration
        tool for documents, storage, communication, calendars, meetings, and approval workflows.     
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why Apple’s ecosystem wins</h2>
      <p>
        Asked what matters most in Apple’s current direction, Ricky highlighted privacy and seamless synchronization across Apple devices, saying
        the result is a more consistent user experience.     
      </p>
      <p>
        He argued Apple invests heavily in integrating hardware and software to create a tightly connected ecosystem that makes it convenient for
        users—and encourages them to buy additional Apple devices to complete the experience.     
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “Privacy and seamless synchronize across Apple device... create a more consistent user experience.”     
      </blockquote>

      <h2>How teams stay productive (and how students should choose)</h2>
      <p>
        To keep teams productive across different operating systems and devices, Ricky described using third-party tools—especially WeCom—to unify
          s, chats, calls, emails, calendars, meetings, and workflows in one place.     
      </p>

      <p>
        For CS students choosing between a MacBook and Windows/Linux, he offered three criteria: (1) match the device to career and learning goals,
        (2) prioritize ease of learning and setup time, and (3) weigh budget and long-term value such as durability and resale.     
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Goal fit:</strong> He said MacBooks are usually better for iOS development or web development because tooling is more complete and
          native, while Windows can be more flexible for entry-level system programming or game development.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Learning speed vs. troubleshooting:</strong> He stated macOS often needs less setup and has fewer environment issues, while
          Windows/Linux may require more setup effort but can build troubleshooting skills and deeper system understanding. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Budget and value:</strong> He emphasized MacBooks cost more upfront but tend to be stable and have stronger resale value, whereas
          Windows/Linux laptops offer more pricing flexibility, potentially higher specs for less money, and more customization.     
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Looking ahead, he predicted Apple’s ecosystem would become stronger, while developer workflows could become easier and systems more
        efficient over the next two to three years. 
      </p>

      <h2>Misconception he challenged</h2>
      <p>
        Ricky pushed back on the idea that Apple products are mainly for “showing off,” arguing that buying an expensive device purely for image
        does not make sense if the performance is unnecessary for the user’s real work. 
      </p>
      <p>
        He concluded with a practical recommendation: choose a device that fits actual needs and the type of work rather than choosing based on
        brand status.
